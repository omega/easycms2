        - Added tag-support to pages. It is up to categorytypes to make use of it though
          Look at the blog type to see an example
        - Fixed some problems with snippets and category frontpages 
          clashing in the stash. Now snippets add their stuff to $snip->url_name
          instead of the clashing category namespace.
        - Added Tag table, and PageTag relation to Page.
        - Added support for categories as homepage
        - Fix a bug in category/cat handling for rendering pages and snippets
        - Fix a != vs ne bug
